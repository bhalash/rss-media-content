# RSS Media Content
This plugin adds a valid [media:content][1] entry to the RSS entry for a given post item, if a featured image exists.

Add post's featured image to the RSS feed. Inspired by code featured

2. Just don't work because they are outdated.
3. Don't work in a valid manner. The current top hit for "WordPress RSS featured image" inserts HTML into the `<description>` field, which is neither standard nor machine-readable.
